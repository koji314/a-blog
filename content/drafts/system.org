#+description: A handy system cultivated through the years of academic study.
As a student of Mathematics and Computer Science, I find myself on the computer *quite alot*, so I have customized a few little neat things that make it easier for me to go through my day.

Note that due to my only recent discovery of Emacs and Org-Mode, I will sound like a bit of a nooblet. I am constantly fine tuning my system and learning about new things.

*Also Note* that most of the content I will talk about here has been configured for usage on =Ubuntu 20.04=, a Linux distribution. However I do have a system in place for usage on other OS such as Windows.

* Notetaking - *Typing Mathematics*
My current setup utilizes a form of emacs known as *Doom Emacs*, utilizing EVIL, (since I began with Vim initially). A lot of my learning and work happens within Emacs at the moment.

A more even lovlier fact is that [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs][Doom-Emacs]] works amazingly right off the bat. Many of the key features I use it for I will break down.
** Notetaking with Org + LaTeX
*Org-Mode* is a thing. I don't really know the extensiveness of it, but the most compelling part was the fact that I could have plaintext coupled with rendered bits of LaTeX. This isn't always neccesary, but its damn cool.
*** Snippets
Doom-Emacs comes with the yas-snippets plugin from the get go, to use them, you can search for them in the Emacs "menu", (accessible with =M-x= or =SPC :=), then you have two main tools: =yas-new-snippet=, and =yas-visit-snippet=, with creating a new snippet you will have syntax like
#+BEGIN_SRC
# -*- mode: snippet -*-
# name: <snippet-title>
# key: <trigger-key>
# --
<your snippet>
#+END_SRC
Since I do a lot of TeX writing within Org-Mode now, a lot of my old TeX Snippets from Vim have been transferred here, a good example is the inline math block.
#+BEGIN_SRC conf
# -*- mode: snippet -*-
# name: Inline Math Mode
# key: m
# --
\($1\)
#+END_SRC
In org mode this will look like this

The concept of snippets makes it plausible to do digital notetaking with something like LaTeX, it is most likely faster than my own handwriting. Arguably more efficient to handwriting but thats for another post...

*** In-text rendering
Emacs has the ability to "render" LaTeX within the org buffer. Note that we are putting render in "quotation" because its not a true render, its a clever render.

Emacs will compile a =.dvi= of the given LaTeX code, then from there, it will attempt to convert that output into a suitable =.png= file, and then place the image within the buffer. I will upload my snippet collection with a cheat sheet sooner or later... but I suggest you design your own snippets to your own taste. (or adapt on my own)
*** Org Agenda and TODO

* Code in Emacs
Since Doom-Emacs flavour contains EVIL, the feel of text editing is a lot like Vim. If you are like me and are used to the Vim bindings and using Vim, you will feel no difference. It is significantly stronger than barebone Vim, good syntax highlighting, in project compiling (Through Projectile), window management works through Emacs and functions similarly to =vsplit= and =hsplit= in Vim.
* Data Syncing
Since one of the core appeals for digitizing notes is to have the accessible through multiple devices. I use a very handy thing called [[https://syncthing.net/][Syncthing]], Rather than a cloudbased server style system, such as Google Drive or OneDrive. Syncthing is just a file synchronization program, with protocols to backup and sync between multiple devices on Linux, Windows, MacOS, and even Android. I have Syncthing installed on my homelab PC, my laptop, and my phone. And as a precaution and just for fun, I built a small server to have my data backed up on (also through Syncthing) and an introducer to the rest of my devices.
