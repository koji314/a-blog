#+TITLE: Hey! You!
*Ralof*: Hey, you. You're finally awake. You were trying to cross the border, right? Walked right into that Imperial ambush, same as us, and that thief over there.

*Lokir*: Damn you Stormcloaks. Skyrim was fine until you came along. Empire was nice and lazy. If they hadn't been looking for you, I could've stolen that horse and been half way to Hammerfell. You there. You and me -- we shouldnâ€™t be here. It's these Stormcloaks the Empire wants.

*Ralof*: We're all brothers and sisters in binds now, thief.

*Imperial Soldier*: Shut up back there!

[Lokirl looks at the gagged man.]

*Lokir*: And what's wrong with him?

*Ralof*: Watch your tongue! You're speaking to Ulfric Stormcloak, the true High King.

*Lokir*: Ulfric? The Jarl of Windhelm? You're the leader of the rebellion. But if they captured you... Oh gods, where are they taking us?

*Ralof*: I don't know where we're going, but Sovngarde awaits.

*Lokir*: No, this can't be happening. This isn't happening.

*Ralof*: Hey, what village are you from, horse thief?

*Lokir*: Why do you care?

*Ralof*: A Nord's last thoughts should be of home.

*Lokir*: Rorikstead. I'm...I'm from Rorikstead.

[They approach the village of Helgen. A soldier calls out to the lead wagon.]

*Imperial Soldier*: General Tullius, sir! The headsman is waiting!

*General Tullius*: Good. Let's get this over with.

*Lokir*: Shor, Mara, Dibella, Kynareth, Akatosh. Divines, please help me.

*Ralof*: Look at him, General Tullius the Military Governor. And it looks like the Thalmor are with him. Damn elves. I bet they had something to do with this.

This is Helgen. I used to be sweet on a girl from here. Wonder if Vilod is still making that mead with juniper berries mixed in. Funny...when I was a boy, Imperial walls and towers used to make me feel so safe.

[A man and son watch the prisoners pull into town.]

*Haming*: Who are they, daddy? Where are they going?

*Torolf*: You need to go inside, little cub.

*Haming*: Why? I want to watch the soldiers.

*Torolf*: Inside the house. Now
