* So... What now...
Alright. I made a blog.

But I have come to the realisation that I don't know what to write... I have a few more technical posts in mind. But a more **general** one? Perhaps.

Roses are red.

Violets are blue.

I'm really tired.

I'm bad at poems...

Maybe lets just play with the bells and whistles in this blog... LaTeX Rendering...
{{<katex "display">}}
f(x) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty\hat f(\xi)\,e^{2 \pi i \xi x}\,d\xi
{{</katex>}}
And maybe some inline like \(\Gamma(x)\)... How about some code...
#+BEGIN_SRC c
/* From Linux Kernel... Thanks Linus.

 * The decision whether SMT is supported can only be done after the full
 * CPU identification. Called from architecture code.
 */
void __init cpu_smt_check_topology(void)
{
	if (!topology_smt_supported())
		cpu_smt_control = CPU_SMT_NOT_SUPPORTED;
}
