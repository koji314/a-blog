Extra invariant introduced to help deduce something like a Torus and
Klein Bottle apart (both have \(\chi (S) = 0\)).

We say a surface is orientable if it is *not* possible for a
2-dimensional object to go across it without mirroring. Examples being a
sphere or torus, there are orientable surfaces.

A non-orientable surface is a Klein Bottle.

Comparing how many vertices removed vs how many components left.
