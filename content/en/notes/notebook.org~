* Preamble - Review
*Please review the notions of groups, rings, and fields by, e.g, looking at the Wikipedia entries.*
** Groups
** Rings
** Fields

I dont know what to write about anymore help.
* Beginning - Real Analysis 
** Continued Fractions
   What the hell is this chapter notes?!?
   For instance,
   \[
   1 + \frac{1}{1+\frac{1}{1+\frac{1}{1+\frac{1}{1+ \cdots}}}}
   \]


  
  *Reformation:* There are bounded subsets of \(\mathbb{Q}\) which have no least upper bound (suprememum)

  Example: \(A = \{x \in \mathbb{Q} | x^2 < 2\}\), bounded but has no (rational) supremum.

  Our goal is to enlarge \(\mathbb{Q}\) to "fill the holes" while at the same time keep all the nice properties (an ordered field). There are two methods to do this.
  1. Cauchy Method
  2. Dedekind Method

** Dedekind Construction of Real Numbers :lec1:
   Construction uses a notion of "cuts".

   *Definition*: A cut in \(\mathbb{Q}\) is a pair of subsets \(A,B \subset \mathbb{Q}\) such that
     (a). \(A \cup B = \mathbb{Q}, \; A \cap B = \phi\), therefore \(A \neq \phi \neq B\)
     (b). If \(a \in A\) and \(b \in B\), then \(a \leq b\)
     (c). \(A\) contains no largest element.

   
   *Example*:
   (i). \(A | B = \mathbb{Q}_{< 0} | \mathbb{Q}_{\geq 0}\), the latter is called the *zero cut*. Replacing zero with any rational number you have the cut corresponding to that number, i.e \(\mathbb{Q}_{\geq x}\) where \(x \in \mathbb{Q}\) (thats recursive)
     (ii). \(A | B = \{x \in \mathbb{Q} : x \leq 0 \text{ or } x^2 < 2\} | \{x \in \mathbb{Q} : x > 0 \text{ or } x^2 \geq 2\}\)

   *Defintion* (Key Definition): A real number is a *cut* in \(\mathbb{Q}\).
   Let \(\mathbb{R}\) be the set of real numbers. Note that \(Q \subseteq \mathbb{R}\),

   If \(\alpha \in \mathbb{Q}\), then define a cut \(\mathbb{Q}_\alpha\) by \(A | B = \mathbB{Q}_{< \alpha} | \mathbb{Q}_{\geq \alpha}\)

   *Definition* Suppose \(x = A | B\) and \(y = C | D\) are two cuts. We say \(x \leq y\) if \(A \subseteq C\) and \(x < y\) if \(A \subsetneq C\).

   *Example* \(\mathbb{Q}_{< 0} \mid \mathbb{Q}_{\geq 0} \leq \mathbb{Q}_{< 1} \mid \mathbb{Q}_{\geq 1}\) and \(\mathbb{Q}_{\sqrt{2}} < \mathbb{Q}_{1.5} = \mathbb{Q}_{1.5} \mid \mathbb{Q}_{\geq 1.5}\)

   *EXERCISE*: I forgot to write it down lol.

   *Definition*: An element \(M \in \mathbb{R}\) is called an *upper bound* for \(S \subseteq \mathbb{Q}\) if \(\forall s \in S\), \(s \leq M\).

   *Example*: Let \(S\) be the set of all cuts less than the zero cut. Then clearly \(\mathbb{Q}_0\) is an upper bound for \(S\).

   *Definition*: An element \(M \in \mathbb{R}\) is called a least upper bound for \(S \subseteq \mathbb{R}\) if
     (i). M is an upper bound.
     (ii). If \(M'\) is another upper bound for \(S\), then \(M \leq M'\).

   *Example*: \(\mathbb{Q}_\sqrt{2}\) is a LUB for \(S =\{x \in \mathbb{Q} | x^2 < \sqrt{2} \}\)

   *Theorem*: \(\mathbb{R}\) is Dedekind Complete; i.e every bounded subset has a least upper bound (aka supremum).

   *Proof*: Let 
   \[C = \{a \in \mathbb{Q} \mid \text{ for some cut } A \mid B \in S, \text{ we have } a \in A = \displaystyle \bigcup_{A \mid B} \in S A\]
   with \(D = \mathbb{Q} - C\).

   *Exercise*: \(\mathbb{Z} = C \mid D\) is actually a cut. Clearly \(\mathbb{Z}\) is an upper bound for \(S\). We claim it is actually a *least upper bound*. Let \(Z' = C' \mid D'\) be any other upper bound for \(S\). By assumption, we have that for \(A \mid B \leq C' \mid D', \; \forall A \mid B \in S\),
   this implies that \(A \subseteq C' \forall A \mid B \in S\) and thus 
   \[
   \bigcup_{A \mid B \in S} = C \subseteq C' \implies Z \leq Z'
   \]

** Cauchy Construction of \(\mathbb{R}\) :lec2:
   *Definition:* Recall that a sequence \((x_n)_{n=1}^\infty\), \(x_n \in \mathbb{Q}\) is Cauchy if \(\forall \varepsilon \in \mathbb{Q}_{> 0}\), there exists \(N = N_\varepsilon\), such that \(|x_n - x_m| < \varepsilon\), \(\forall n,m > N\). (Note the emphasis that \(N\) depends on \(\varepsilon\))

   *Example*: 
   1. Let \(x_n\) be any sequence \(\in \mathbb{Q}\), whose limit is also \(\in \mathbb{Q}\), e.g \(x_n = \frac{1}{n}\), 
      \[
      \lim_{n\to \infty} x_n = 0
      \]
   2. Take the partial sum sequence
      \[
      x_n = 1 - \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} - \cdots + (-1)^{n+1} \frac{1}{n} = \sum_{k = 1}^n \frac{(-1)^{k+1}}{k}
      \]
      Then \(x_n\) does not converge in \(\mathbb{Q}\), but it *is Cauchy*, (Exercise - PROVE). 


   Let \(\ell\) be the *set of all Cauchy sequence of \(\mathbb{Q}\)*
      
   _GOOD NEWS_: \(\ell\) is closed under addition and multiplication, thus \(\ell\) is a ring.

   _BAD NEWS_: \(\exists\) non-zero Cauchy seq. which have no inverse, e.g no sequence satisfies
   \[
   (1,0,\cdots, 0) \cdot (x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_n, \cdots) = (1,1,1, \cdots, )
   \]
   *Key Definition*: 
   1. A cauchy seq is equivalent to zero if \(\lim_{n\to\infty} |x_n| = 0\)
   2. Two cauchy seqs \((x_n)\) and \((y_n)\) are equivalent if \(x_n - y_n\) is equivalent to 0.

   *Exercise* - Showing this is an equivalence relation (defines one atleast), i.e show reflexibility, symmetry and transitivity.

   *Defn*. Define \(\mathbb{R}\) to be the set of equivalence claimes(?) of Cauchy sequences of rationals, i.e
   \[
   \mathbb{R} := \frac{C}{n}
   \]
