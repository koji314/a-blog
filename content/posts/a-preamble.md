I should really be studying

```c
#include<stdio.h>
int main() {
    printf("Hello World!\n");
}
```
I would really like you to render please. 

{{<katex "display">}}
f(x) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty\hat f(\xi)\,e^{2 \pi i \xi x}\,d\xi
{{</katex >}}

Oh my god finally it worked, this is fantastic what about inline... {{<katex>}}\Gamma(z){{</katex>}}. Ok this is epic.
